### Instructions

**Task**: Edit the code to make the printed text mirror what we type into the input
field. When we erase all of the text, nothing should be printed to the screen.

Remember that the React component that renders the form also controls what
happens in that form on user input.

This exercise will help you solidify what you've learned about Controlled Components.

# Task

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
3. Open `./src/App.js` and begin making edits.
4. Edit the code to make the printed text mirror what we type into the input field. When we erase all of the text, nothing should be printed to the screen.
